---- Decorator


--definition:
     "is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes."
     "is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework."
     "The primary goal of a Facade Pattern is not to avoid you having to read the manual of a complex API. Itâ€™s only a side-effect.
     The first goal is to reduce coupling and follow the Law of Demeter."


-- Examples
1- image converter [ simple interface deal with all convert method ]
2- Computer Power On Or Off [  turnOn , turnOff ] in one facade


-- Pros and Cons
--- Props
1-  You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.
--- Cons
1- A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.

-- When Use It
1- when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
2- when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.
